# Talk Proposal Reviewer Comments

The submission of the talk proposal "pyhf: a pure Python statistical fitting library from the high energy physics community with tensors and autograd" to SciPy 2019 was not accepted (but was very generously offered a poster instead!) &mdash;  168 talk proposals were submitted for 60 available speaking. However, SciPy follows a double-open review process and so the review comments were very nice to get back. They are as follows:

- **PAPER:** 198
- **TITLE:** pyhf: a pure Python statistical fitting library from the high energy physics community with tensors and autograd
- **AUTHORS:** Matthew Feickert, Lukas Heinrich and Giordon Stark

## Review 1

**Overall evaluation:** 5 (strong accept)

### Overall evaluation

- **Is the abstract clear?** - Yes
- **Is the abstract complete?** - Yes
- **Is the abstract compelling?** - Yes
- **How relevant, immediately useful and novel is the topic?** - Novel and useful

Very clear and compelling abstract. The authors have provided a clear structure of their talk, including explaining terms to a broader audience, explaining the package, future efforts, and time for questions. They specifically mention how scientific python has helped them in their particular domain which is highly relevant to the scipy community. Further they have provided github links to their code and an example of a publication that has used their package.

Thank you to the authors for the descriptive abstract!

## Review 2

**Overall evaluation:** 4 (accept)

### Overall evaluation

The abstract of this talk provides a detailed breakdown of the talk which I found very useful and compelling. The topic is of interest to the SciPy community as it implements code in Python which has only been done in C++ previously. The Python library that is being discussed supports other extremely useful libraries and tools. Overall it would be a nice talk for physicists and statisticians.


## Review 3

**Overall evaluation:** 5 (strong accept)

### Overall evaluation

This talk greatly aligned and answered many great questions such as "Who is the intended audience for your talk?" and  "What, specifically, will attendees learn from your talk? ". And the best part is this talk targets all types of audiences.

## Review 4

**Overall evaluation:** 4 (accept)

### Overall evaluation

Abstract clearly highlights the importance usage of "pyhf" library. This abstract is generally well written. Presenters provide detailed outline of their talk with timing for each section. This will be very interesting talk for high-energy physics community.
