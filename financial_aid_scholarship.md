## Community Contributions & Financial Need

Please highlight your contributions to the scientific Python community. Here are a few example questions that may help frame your answer; note that you don’t have to answer all of them. You may use Markdown to help highlight aspects of your application, but likewise, this is not compulsory.

### What open source software projects have you made contributions to, and what was the nature of your contribution? Are there any publicly-accessible pull request or commit data? (< 500 characters)

I am one of the creators and core developers of [pyhf](https://github.com/diana-hep/pyhf) &mdash; the statistical modelling library that I applied to give a talk on at SciPy 2019. I have also made contributions to [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot) as [seen here](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) in which I added support for the documentation which is written in Jupyter notebooks can be run with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

### What open source projects are you spearheading, and what is the nature/purpose of that project? What was your contribution to the project? Are there any publicly-accessible pull request or commit data?

I am one of the creator and core developers of [pyhf](https://github.com/diana-hep/pyhf) --- the statistical modelling library that I applied to give a talk on at SciPy 2019. A summary of my contributions can be seen [on our GitHub page](https://github.com/diana-hep/pyhf/graphs/contributors).

### How have you contributed to local or under-represented groups’ scientific Python communities? What has your role been - as an organizer, secretary, treasurer, others? Is there a referee that we may contact?

I can't say that I have much. At the research laboratory where I've spent most of my Ph.D. and lived close to, the Python community was mostly other researchers who already knew Python and were using it for work.

### What talks/tutorials have you presented at previous scientific Python conferences? Have you submitted a talk for consideration at this year’s SciPy conference?

I have not presented at a previous Python conference.

### What other community contributions have you made that we have not captured in the questions above?

> Please note that we do not consider "I have published many scientific papers" to be a community contribution. However, you may indicate how your publications promoted the use of the SciPy stack and open science. Do also consider other creative ways that you may have contributed to the scientific Python community.

Being somewhat new to the community I can't point to any direct large contributions. The closest I can say is trying to expand the community in my field by increasing the use of scientific Python in the experimental particle physics community.

### How would the SciPy scholarship enable your attendance at the SciPy conference?

> SciPy FinAid seeks to maximize the impact of the conference by enabling people to attend who would not otherwise be able to. Please establish why FinAid would make the difference in your ability to attend. For example is SciPy outside of the scope of your existing funding? Or are you in between school/jobs, or potentially attending this conference out-of-pocket? Please note that simply being a student does not automatically qualify you for FinAid, nor does not being a student disqualify you from it.

As a Ph.D. student I don't have the out-of-pocket financial resources to afford to travel to the SciPy 2019 conference without financial support (I am finishing my Ph.D. in Illinois, so even though I am affiliated with a university in Texas I can't just drive to Austin in under a day). All of my current research funding is through grants from the United States Department of Energy that has strict requirements on direct spending on physics research, which the SciPy conference unfortunately does not count as. I would be unable to attend the conference without any financial aid. I have additionally already used my University's graduate research travel fellowship for a trip related to my physics research, so I have already exhausted my ability to seek funding from Southern Methodist University.

### Please indicate funding that you have already secured, or how you may be able to creatively fund your trip to SciPy 2019, indicate what it may cover (flight, lodging, registration, or some combination), and total US dollar amount (if applicable).

> We are looking to maximize the number of participants that we can help bring to the conference, so if you have already secured certain funds for travel to SciPy 2019, or are willing to use creative ways to fund your travel (e.g. using frequent flyer points), it would demonstrate dedication to the scientific computing community, help us bring a broader range of people to the conference, and would help bolster our case for bringing you to the conference on a scholarship. FinAid award recipients receive a single room, so room sharing is not necessary.

I don't have any outside funding that I can draw on, given the answer to the previous question. However, I do have close friends that live in Austin, so I could stay with them for the duration of the conference.

### How many days of sprints are you intending to stay for?

> We wish to encourage participation in financial aid, and have a separate budget for sprint participation. If you are selected for a SciPy scholarship, we will cover additional days of lodging for you.
